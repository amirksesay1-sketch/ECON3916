🍔 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis

Lab 1: Testing the Law of One Price with the Big Mac Index

🎯 Objective

To empirically test the Law of One Price by using the Big Mac Index as a proxy for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), evaluating whether exchange rates equalize the cost of identical goods across countries when expressed in a common currency.

🧪 Methodology

This project applies a simplified but powerful framework from international economics—Burgernomics—to assess global currency misalignment:

Constructed a raw dataset from The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index using manually defined Python dictionaries, reinforcing data ingestion fundamentals.

Calculated implied PPP exchange rates by comparing the local-currency price of a Big Mac to its U.S. dollar price.

Measured currency misalignment by computing the percentage deviation between implied PPP rates and observed market exchange rates.

Interpreted deviations as indicators of currency overvaluation or undervaluation, consistent with PPP theory.

📊 Key Findings

The analysis revealed significant deviations from Purchasing Power Parity across countries, indicating that exchange rates do not fully equalize consumer purchasing power in practice.

For example, [insert your finding here, e.g., “the Norwegian Krone was overvalued by X% relative to the U.S. dollar”], suggesting that goods priced in Norway were more expensive in dollar terms than predicted by PPP.

Such misalignments imply limited arbitrage due to real-world frictions, including trade barriers, non-tradable inputs (e.g., labor and rent), taxation, and local market structures.

The results reinforce the idea that PPP is more effective as a long-run benchmark than a short-run predictor of exchange rates.

Overall, this lab demonstrates how a simple price index can be leveraged to test foundational economic theory while highlighting the gap between theoretical parity conditions and observed market outcomes.
