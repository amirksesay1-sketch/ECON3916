# ECON3916
# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my academic and applied portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. It documents my progression in using modern data science tools to analyze economic questions through both causal and predictive lenses.

## 📘 About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student actively preparing for roles in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**. My academic focus lies at the intersection of **economic theory, statistical inference, and machine learning**.

This portfolio reflects a *concept extension* approach to learning:  
I begin with foundational econometric and statistical concepts—such as linear regression, hypothesis testing, and causal reasoning—and extend them using modern machine learning methods like **regularization, model selection, and predictive optimization**.

Throughout this repository, you will find coursework and labs that emphasize:
- Combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Translating economic theory into data-driven models
- Evaluating tradeoffs between interpretability and predictive performance
- Writing clean, reproducible, and well-documented code

My goal is to demonstrate the ability to bridge traditional economics with modern data science practices in a rigorous and practical way.
